# Cloudflare Pages Build Configuration

## Exact Settings for Cloudflare Dashboard

Copy these settings exactly into your Cloudflare Pages project:

### Build Configuration
```
Framework preset: Next.js (Static HTML Export) (or "None")
Build command: npm run build
Build output directory: out
Root directory: (empty)
Node version: 18 (or higher)
Deploy command: (MUST BE EMPTY - do NOT type "deploy" or any text - leave completely blank)
```

### What Each Setting Does

- **Build command:** Runs `npm run build` which executes `next build` and generates static files
- **Build output directory:** `out` - This is where Next.js outputs static files (configured in `next.config.ts`)
- **Deploy command:** EMPTY - Cloudflare Pages automatically deploys the `out` directory after build

### Why This Works

1. `npm run build` executes the build script in `package.json`
2. Next.js compiles your app and generates static HTML files
3. Files are output to the `out` directory (because `next.config.ts` has `output: 'export'`)
4. Cloudflare Pages automatically detects the `out` directory and deploys it
5. No deploy command needed - Pages handles deployment automatically

### Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:
- Verify `out` directory exists after build (check build logs)
- Ensure `next.config.ts` has `output: 'export'`
- Make sure "Deploy command" field is completely empty
- Check that Node version is 18 or higher
